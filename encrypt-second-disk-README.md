The playbook calls the `role/encrypt-second-disk` role and implements one task:
– Implement the procedure of encrypting the second disk in the system (where there is no root partition) (partition name should be specified in the inventory).
Implement a procedure to encrypt the partition that is present on the disk next to the root partition.
